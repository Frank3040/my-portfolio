Francisco Chan Pech is a Data Engineering student at the Universidad Politécnica de Yucatán, with hands-on experience in the design, automation, and implementation of data pipelines, RPA solutions, and data warehouses for analytical and decision-making purposes. He has worked remotely as a Data Engineer at XPERT-IA, where he designed and implemented RPA automation bots for data extraction from CRM systems using GUI control in Python, incorporating robust error-handling, validation, and data-cleaning processes.

Previously, he collaborated with UNAM ENES Mérida, developing automated data ingestion tools for oceanographic forecasts from the HYCOM (HYbrid Coordinate Ocean Model) server, migrating and refactoring legacy download workflows to improve standardization and maintainability for research use. He also contributed to the design of ELT pipelines and data visualizations for the analysis of meteorological variables, achieving a significant reduction in manual workload through end-to-end automation.

He has developed end-to-end projects including a Data Warehouse on GCP using BigQuery and Looker Studio to analyze urban mobility patterns in New York City, as well as a complete ELT pipeline for a video streaming platform built with Python, SQL, Docker, Airflow, dbt, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and Power BI. He has complemented his academic training with Data Engineering certifications in Python and SQL from DataCamp, and holds an upper-intermediate (B2) level of English proficiency.
