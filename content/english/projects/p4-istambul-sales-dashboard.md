The dataset contains information about shopping transactions from 10 distinct shopping malls in Istanbul from 2021 to 2023, it is important to mention that both years, 2021 and 2022 are complete, while 2023 is incomplete, only the first two months are available.

## Results of the Analysis
The analysis of shopping transactions from ten shopping malls in Istanbul (2021–2023) reveals several relevant customer and sales patterns.

The majority of customers belong to the 55–69 age group, which also accounts for the highest total spending, indicating that this segment has strong purchasing power and high engagement.

In terms of gender distribution, female customers represent 59.72% of total transactions, making them the dominant customer segment across the dataset.

The top five product categories by sales volume are clothing, shoes, technology, cosmetics, and toys, with clothing leading overall consumption. This highlights a strong demand for fashion-related products across all malls.

Regarding payment methods, cash is the most frequently used payment type, followed by credit cards and debit cards, suggesting a continued preference for traditional payment methods despite the availability of electronic options.

From a temporal perspective, Mondays register the highest number of transactions, indicating increased consumer activity at the start of the week.

Finally, sales revenue remains relatively stable across the three-year period, with no significant year-over-year growth or decline. This suggests consistent performance but limited organic growth during the analyzed timeframe.
